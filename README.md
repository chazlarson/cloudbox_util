# cloudbox_util
A utility script to provide simple aliases to various cloudbox functions.

Work in progress

## install

```
curl "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chazlarson/cloudbox_util/master/cb.sh" > /opt/scripts/cb.sh; chmod +x /opt/scripts/cb.sh
```

## enable

One way is to add this to the end of your `.bashrc` [or `.zshrc` or whatever your shell uses]
```
alias cb='/opt/scripts/cb.sh'
```
Log out and back in, and now you can execute it by typing `cb` anywhere.

More details and an alternative is discussed here:
